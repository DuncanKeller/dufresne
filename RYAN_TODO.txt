Some stuff that needs work - have at whatever you feel like. Prioritized from "least likely that I'll do it" to "I'll get around to it eventually"

Emscripten
-Self explanatory. Getting it into the project and such

Package robustness
-Right now asset manager just loads loose packages, so adding the ability to load a zip as a package,
	and even load from the exe
-Asset manager in general needs some cleaning up, so be warned. Probably no major changes to it
	except for making everything use the same string class. You can think about the string
	class we will use if you want to.

Sound
-Playwave doesn't compile for me, so I haven't been eager to work on this
-Asset Manager can return a void* to the asset and the size of the memory block,
	so a way to create a SDL music/sound file using that would be good
	(doesn't actually need to interface with asset manager, just a method
	like PlaySound(void* sound, int soundSize) would be cool
-Basic features like looping for music, volume, stuff like that
-Simpler the better, it would be nice to be able to call it from anywhere in the project
	with input, I basically have it inherit from gameSystem.cpp, and will have a input obj
	at global scope

Meshes
-Mesh class is a stub. Since we're doing 2D we mainly need a square, but
	polygons would be nice too.
-Needs to load verts and UV coords into a GL vertex buffer object.

Component robustness
-Component system if pretty bare-bones right now, and has a lot of stub code. 
	Feel free to work on that if you'd like.

Box2D integration
-Self explanatory. 

Basic collision stuff
-Bounding box classes, collision detection code, etc
